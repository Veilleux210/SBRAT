> Check out [Veilleux210/SUS-AUTH](https://github.com/Veilleux210/SUS-AUTH), a session id login mod.


## Features
- Grabs the **username, uuid, token, ip, feather file, essentials file and discord tokens** of a target as a *JSON*.

- Additionally, it stores a **formatted session string** ready to use with [Veilleux210/SUS-AUTH](https://github.com/Veilleux210/SUS-AUTH).
- JavaScript backend server which:
  - Checks if all fields in the JSON are present.
  - Controls requests and filters out spam requests by IPs.
  - Validates the token with Minecraft Auth servers before proceeding to output the data.

  It also fakes returning 404 codes to make the people think they successfully crashed the server ðŸ¤¡.
  
- Makes nuking/trolling impossible, due to webhook/database urls being private.
- Can be easily configured to either use `Discord Webhooks` or `MongoDB` or both.
- Bypasses PizzaClient's SessionProtection.

- Uses:
  - *Express* for the backend server.
  - *MongoDB* for storing ratted users.
  - *Discord API* for sending messages to webhook.
